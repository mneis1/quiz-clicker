# Development
`npm run dev` is your friend here!
It will concurrently run the backend and frontend and auto-update as you edit code.

## Don't forget to run `npm i` for the back and front ends!

## Test credentials
You should be able to register a new user with the current setup but just incase:
"nehman1@umbc.edu" "password"
